# scratch-vm-src
There are some helpful instruction for me to create my own block in Scratch VM. It is important to make sure that the extended file is modified in the scratch-vm, such as extensions. If we want to use own block in GUI, it suggests to do the modified in the scratch-gui file. Go to .extensions in scratch-gui, and modified the index.jsx.
Although the Scratch programming language is designed for kids to learn programming, there are still some interesting thing keep updating in the Scratch Project. For me, it is a good start point to learn some javascript, and it could create a template to interact. If there is any new stuff or finding, i will updating in the folder.
